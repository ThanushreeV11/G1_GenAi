Role	Question	Answer
Software Engineer	Explain the difference between a process and a thread.	A process is an independent program in execution with its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight sub-process that shares memory with other threads in the same process. Threads are faster to create and use fewer resources compared to processes.
Software Engineer	What is the time complexity of binary search and why?	The time complexity of binary search is O(log n) because the algorithm repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
Data Scientist	How do you handle missing data in a dataset?	Depending on the context, I might remove rows, fill missing values with mean/median/mode, or use algorithms that support missing values like XGBoost. For more accuracy, I also use imputation methods like KNN or MICE.
Data Scientist	What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?	Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models, whereas unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to discover hidden patterns or groupings in the data.
Cloud Engineer	What is the difference between scaling vertically and horizontally in cloud computing?	Vertical scaling means increasing resources of a single server (e.g., CPU/RAM), while horizontal scaling means adding more servers to distribute the load.
Cloud Engineer	How does load balancing work in cloud architecture?	Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance. It can be done at different layers like application, transport, or network.
Frontend Developer	What is the virtual DOM in React?	The virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. React updates the virtual DOM first, compares it with the previous version, and then efficiently updates only the changed parts of the real DOM.
Frontend Developer	Explain the concept of 'lifting state up' in React.	Lifting state up refers to moving state to the closest common ancestor of components that need to share that state. This helps in managing state and prop drilling more effectively.
